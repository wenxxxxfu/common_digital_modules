You are provided with a BCD one-digit adder named bcd_fadd that adds two BCD digits and carry-in, and produces a sum and carry-out.

<code>
module bcd_fadd (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input     cin,
    output   cout,
    output [3:0] sum );
</code>

Instantiate 100 copies of bcd_fadd to create a 100-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. Your adder should add two 100-digit BCD numbers (packed into 400-bit vectors) and a carry-in to produce a 100-digit sum and carry out.
